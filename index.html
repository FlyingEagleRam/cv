        Working as a freelancer in Front-end development with ReactJs eCommerce projects. Have been actively working as a freelancer from June 2020.

        I worked as a Technical Support Executive with Diversified Business Solutions Pvt Ltd. Have worked there for a brief 1 year.

        Since, Javascript was already known to me, I started learning React because of it's popular demand in business. After few months i got my first freelancing project in November 2020.

        And this marks the inception of my freelancing career in web development.
